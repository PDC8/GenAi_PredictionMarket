Product: Agentic Prediction Markets Terminal (Demo MVP)

Objective
- Demonstrate an end-to-end forecasting workflow with auditable orchestration, simulated execution,
  and feedback-driven trust updates.

Core components
1) Knowledge Engine
- Pull live Kalshi market snapshots (with seeded fallback).
- Maintain trust-weighted signal store and source attribution.

2) Orchestration Layer
- Plan/reason over market context.
- Run deterministic probability engine; optionally blend LLM output.
- Produce confidence, opportunity signal, recommendation, and position sizing.
- Persist step logs + input snapshot for auditability.

3) Feedback Loop
- On market resolution, compare prediction vs outcome.
- Emit correction report and update source trust weights.
- Reuse updated trust in subsequent runs.

MVP constraints
- Single-user local deployment.
- Kalshi read-only integration.
- No real trading; simulation only.
- No auth, no marketplace subscriptions, no private data connectors.

Key success metrics
- TTFP (Time-to-First-Prediction)
- Agent Unit Economics (net alpha minus compute/API cost proxy)
- Demo TCO delta estimate
